Westeros 1.01.22 Release Notes
------------------------------

Date: Jan 28, 2020
Tag: Westeros-1.01.22
Changes:

* Avoid event thread safety issue introduced in Wayland 1.17.91

* brcm: fix slow pause/resume transition

* v4l2: use gst-video to parse colorimetry if available

* Video updates:

-add support for SEI time codes.  Time codes attached as GstVideoTimeCodeMeta to received buffers can be used to cause a new
'timecode-callback' signal to fire each time a frame with a new time code is presented.  Time code processing and signal
generation is disabled by default but can be enabled via the 'enable-timecode' property

* Support querying formats and modifiers for EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers

* Get egl display with eglGetCurrentDisplay in embedded renderer

* v4l2: correct surface size on transition to graphics path

* Virtual embedded updates:

Add ability to bind externally launched clients to specific virtual embedded compositor instances
-add unbound client listener
-add bind client api

* v4l2+drm updates:

-add support for frame advance.  Not yet supported by amlogic avsync module

* test: add video position tests for drm

* video updates:

-Add a 'raw' video backend for westerossink.  Building westerossink with
this backend results in a sink that accepts raw video frames which it can
display either to the Westeros video server (see drm/westeros-gl) on KMS
systems and/or as textures to a Westeros compositor.  This allows a KMS
system to use device specific HW video decoder elements terminated with a
raw video westerossink

* video updates:

-assorted fixes for raw sink

* video updates:

-post bus message for decode error brcm and v4l2.  For brcm and v4l2 this error message will be posted
if decoding fails to start.  For brcm it will also be posed if the Nexus video decode error count changes

* v4l2: add support for AV1 codec

* video updates:

-add a 'decode-error-callback' signal that can be enabled via a 'report-decode-errors' property
-change decode error message to be based on GST_STREAM_ERROR
-post decode error message only for issues preventing decoding from starting normally

* raw sink: miscellaneous fixes

* drm: add alternate swap locking

-an alternate mutex positioning can be enabled by adding '-DEGL_SWAP_LOCK_2' when building drm westeros-gl.
By default the current locking is used.  It has been found that the EGL implementations on some devices
required the alternate locking

* raw-sink: fixes for dma-buf operation

* v4l2: fix boundary error feeding out-of-segment buffers to decoder

* v4l2: add a reduced memory mode

* drm: add support for EGL protected content:

-by default protected content (secure graphics) is disabled
-enabled at runtime by defining the env var 'export WESTEROS_SECURE_GRAPHICS=1'

* drm: add support for gbm modifiers:

-support is disabled at build type by default.  Enable by passing --enable-gbm-modifiers to configure
-support is disabled at runtime by default.  Enable at runtime by defining WESTEROS_GL_USE_GBM_MODIFIERS=1 to env

* sink: add support for pixel aspect ratio

* v4l4: add logs for HDR values

* drm+v4l2+raw updates:

-changes to the sink rectangle property are now sent to the video server for immediate application when video
is presenting on a video plane

* v4l2: raw: add show-video-window property

* sink: improve pixel-aspect-ratio handling

* brcm sink: update set start pts:

-don't flush decoder on new start pts if data is already queued or frames already decoded

* v4l2: more memory reductions for low memory mode

* drm: video src cropping fixes

* v4l2: raw: add zoom-mode and overscan-size properties

* v4l2: raw: zoom updates:

-set default overscan-size to 0
-apply overscan to all zoom modes except none and direct

* drm: amlogic: adjust video plane sort order

-On Amlogic, adjust the video plane sort order so that the plane with HDR support is assigned the lowest z-order

* Add support for video texture cropping:

-add vpc_surface_set_geometry_with_crop to vpc protocol
-apply cropping to video textures in v4l2 and raw sinks

* compositor: don't hole punch prior to getting vpc geometry

* bcrm sink: don't wait for playing state to fire first frame signal

* sink: v4l2, raw: add support for underflow signal
