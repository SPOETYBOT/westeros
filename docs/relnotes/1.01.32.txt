-the black list is a mechanism to prevent certain entities from requesting
resources at certain times.  Each requesting entity is assigned an appid,
which is a string, via the env var ESSRMGR_APPID.  An application manager
can add and remove appid's from a black list and while an appid is in the
black list that application is not permitted to request or hold resources

* erm: fix possible bad appid

* v4l2: fix race condition between dequeue and decoder teardown
